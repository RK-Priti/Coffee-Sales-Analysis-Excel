Coffee-Sales-Analysis [Excel]

I created a Excel dashboard to analyze coffee sales data, focusing on key insights:
Sales Trends: Tracked total sales over time across different coffee types (Arabica, Excelsa, Liberica, Robusta).
Sales by Country: Identified the United States as the top-performing market.
Customer Insights: Analyzed top 5 customers contributing the most to sales.
Product Preferences: Filtered sales based on roast type, size, and loyalty card usage.
